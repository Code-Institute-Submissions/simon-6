A classic memory game designed for all ages to enjoy. The Simon Game is simple:- a set of colours flash in a randomised sequence and the player must respond by repeating the sequence back, clicking on the colours in the order that they appeared. The game feature 3 different levels to make it more challenging as it progresses. And options to customize the game sounds and starting levels. [The Simon Game](https://fdeboo.github.io/simon/)

## UX

### Project Goals

To create a version of the Simon game that is intuitive and....

Who is my target audience? 
The game is for children through to adults looking who are looking to challenge their mind. The game should be bright and positive and not dull and miserable. A good experience is one where the game can be played obstructed, intuitive and the focus of the page. Any other links and information should be available but not in the way of the game. 


Provide a clean... The code must be able to start a sequence of colours when a button is click to trigger the start. It must also al. Getting the game to respond to the user input both in success and in failure.

I want to keep them from being bored so I allow the game to get harder by decreasing the amount of time the flash appears  so that there is less to spent on each colour





In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
