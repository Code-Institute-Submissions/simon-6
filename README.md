A classic memory game designed for all ages to enjoy. The Simon Game is simple:- a set of colours flash in a randomised sequence and the player must respond by repeating the sequence back, clicking on the colours in the order that they appeared. The game features 3 different levels to make it more challenging as it progresses. And options to customize the game sounds and starting levels.
