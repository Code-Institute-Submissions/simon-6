A classic memory game designed for all ages to enjoy. The Simon Game is simple:- a set of colours flash in a randomised sequence. The player must respond by repeating the sequence back, clicking on the colours in the order that they appeared. The game features 3 different levels so that it becomes more challenging as it progresses. And options to customize the game sounds and starting levels.

## UX <a name="introduction"></a>

### Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>
The objective is to build an interactive game that users of all ages are able to engage with. It should provide them with a fun, vibrant and positive overall experience whilst keeping them engaged by offering them a challenge.
 
### Scope <a name="scope"></a>
The game will be built with Javascript and the JQuery framework to make it function. It will respond to correct responses from the user by adding points to the scoreline. Incorrect responses will trigger a game over message. 
### Structure <a name="structure"></a>
The game is the focus of the application and so will also be the focus of the user interface. Any extra features will be available through the subtle means of a nav burgericon that toggles a nav menu. The nav menu will be kept off screen until it is toggled, thus creating an onobstructed space for the game to be  played. Only the features relevant to the gameplay 
### Skeleton <a name="skeleton"></a>
### Surface <a name="surface"></a>
The game should be bright and positive through the use of bright colours and a minimalistic, uncluttered but intuitive interface. Any other links and information should be available but not in the way of the game. 





Provide a clean uncluttered interface.... The code must be able to start a sequence of colours when a button is click to trigger the start. Getting the game to respond to the user input both in success and in failure.

I want to keep them from being bored so I allow the game to get harder by decreasing the amount of time the flash appears  so that there is less to spent on each colour





## Features <a name="features"></a>
### Existing Features <a name="existing_feat"></a>
+ A settings model allows the user to choose alternative game sounds from a drop down menu. These are implemented straight away after clicking ok. The user may also choose the starting level for the game from this panel.
+ A feedeback modal allows a user to send feedback to the developer via emailjs 
+ A high scores modal gives the user information about the 5 top scores they have recorded which hopefully keeps them engages in wanting to improve upon their scores.
